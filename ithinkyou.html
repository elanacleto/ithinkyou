    	    This thing started as an effort to show to you --and myself-- that, even through distance, we can exist together. I finally find a reason to finish this blog, to reiterate that, every day which was written here, I loved you. And today, I love you more than any of the 133 days chronologized here. Tomorrow, I will love you more. And when the time to look back on a whole lifetime together for one last time arrives (gunshot provided or not), I know I’ll be able to look in your eyes one more time and think: today, I love you more than I ever have. As since that March 24th, that has always been the case, no exceptions – not a single moment has been an exception. I’m so proud to love you, so proud of having you, and your love makes me feel so proud; and as short as you stand next to me, I look up to you. There’s 61 days from now until I see you again, and although they won’t be talked about here anymore, as always and forever -- i think you.
